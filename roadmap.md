# kfa Text-to-Speech App Roadmap

## Project Goal
Create a **high-quality** web application to test and validate the kfa phonetic system through text-to-speech functionality. Uses a React frontend with a high-performance C++ TTS server backend for neural-quality speech synthesis with precise phonetic control.

- [x] All diphthongs: ey, ay, uO, au, iE, eE, UE, oUy
- [x] All 24 consonants including special mappings
- [x] Comprehensive testing and validation

## ‚úÖ Phase 3: Complete System Integration üß¨ [COMPLETED]

### 3.1 Full Phonetic System ‚úÖ
- [x] All 10 core vowels implemented and tested

### 3.2 Advanced Features ‚úÖ
- [x] Two-panel responsive interface (controls + documentation)
- [x] Quick-access example chips for different kfa categories
- [x] Complete kfa reference documentation panel
- [x] Gettysburg Address and homophone demonstrations
- [x] Comprehensive speech parameter controls

### 3.3 Quality Assessment & Decision Point ‚úÖ
- [x] Tested eSpeak vs eSpeak-NG quality (no significant improvement)
- [x] Compared with Amazon Polly quality (significantly better neural synthesis)
- [x] **Decision**: Move beyond browser-only for production-quality speech
