# kfa Text-to-Speech App Roadmap

## Project Goal
Create a **100% client-side** web application to test and validate the kfa phonetic system through text-to-speech functionality. No backend required - just pure React + Web Speech API for instant, accent-accurate pronunciation testing.

- [ ] Basic error handling for unsupported browsers

### 2.2 Direct kfa ‚Üí Speech Implementation
- [ ] **NO SERVER NEEDED:** Direct kfa text to speech synthesis
- [ ] Connect "Speak" button to Web Speech API
- [ ] Test Montana English pronunciation accuracy
- [ ] Add loading states and audio feedback
- [ ] Basic playback controls (play/pause/stop)

### 2.3 kfa Phoneme Mapping Foundation
- [ ] Create kfa phoneme mapping types/interfaces
- [ ] Start with 5-10 core vowels (u, i, y, E, a)
- [ ] Test basic kfa: `bit` ‚Üí instant speech (no IPA conversion!)
- [ ] Validate sounds match Montana English expectations

---

## Phase 3: Complete kfa System Integration üß¨

### 3.1 All Core Vowels
- [ ] Implement all 10 core vowels: u, i, y, E, a, O, e, A, o, U
- [ ] Test each vowel in isolation
- [ ] Test vowels in simple CVC patterns (consonant-vowel-consonant)
- [ ] Debug and adjust mappings as needed

### 3.2 Diphthong Combinations
- [ ] Implement ey, ay, uO, au combinations
- [ ] Implement iE, eE, UE combinations  
- [ ] Implement complex oUy (3-vowel combination)
- [ ] Test famous words: "day" ‚Üí dey, "house" ‚Üí haus, "beer" ‚Üí biE

### 3.3 All Consonants
- [ ] Implement all 24 consonants from kfa system
- [ ] Test special characters: T (TH-this), Q (TH-thin), S (SH), Z (ZH), G (NG), J (J sound), c (CH)
- [ ] Test complex words from Gettysburg Address examples

### 3.4 System Validation
- [ ] Test homophones: wic (which/witch), TeE (they're/their/there), yOr (your/you're)
- [ ] Test complete sentences from README examples
- [ ] Create phoneme testing interface for individual sound validation

---

## Phase 4: Enhanced User Experience üé®

### 4.1 Playback Controls
- [ ] Speed control slider
- [ ] Pitch control slider
- [ ] Voice selection (if multiple voices available)
- [ ] Volume control

### 4.2 Visual Feedback
- [ ] Highlight current word being spoken
- [ ] Show phoneme breakdown on hover
- [ ] Display kfa ‚Üí IPA ‚Üí English mappings
- [ ] Progress indicator for longer texts

### 4.3 Example Library
- [ ] Add preset examples (Gettysburg Address, confusion examples)
- [ ] Quick-load buttons for testing common phonemes
- [ ] Save/load custom examples

---

## Phase 5: Translation Features üîÑ

### 5.1 English to kfa Translation
- [ ] Basic English word lookup table
- [ ] Simple rule-based pronunciation guessing
- [ ] Handle common English spelling patterns
- [ ] Test with confusion word examples

### 5.2 IPA Integration
- [ ] IPA symbol recognition and parsing
- [ ] IPA to kfa mapping tables
- [ ] kfa to IPA reverse mapping
- [ ] Bidirectional conversion testing

### 5.3 Advanced Translation
- [ ] Handle multiple pronunciations
- [ ] Regional dialect considerations
- [ ] Stress marking and syllable breaks
- [ ] Compound word handling

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Deployment üöÄ

### 6.1 Error Handling & Validation
- [ ] Input validation for kfa text
- [ ] Clear error messages for invalid phonemes
- [ ] Graceful fallbacks for unsupported features
- [ ] User guidance and help system

### 6.2 Performance & Accessibility
- [ ] Performance optimization for large texts
- [ ] Accessibility features (screen reader compatibility)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Mobile touch optimizations

### 6.3 Static Deployment
- [ ] User guide and help documentation
- [ ] Build optimized production bundle
- [ ] Deploy static files to Digital Ocean
- [ ] Add live demo link to main README
- [ ] Share with community for testing and feedback

---

## Phase 7: Accent Variations & Demonstrations üåç

### 7.1 Montana English Baseline
- [ ] Document Montana English as the primary kfa reference
- [ ] Create accent profile with key distinguishing features
- [ ] Test all phonemes against Montana pronunciation
- [ ] Establish baseline recordings for comparison

### 7.2 Accent Mapping System
- [ ] Research Web Speech API voice/accent options
- [ ] Create accent selection interface
- [ ] Map common accent variations (Southern, Boston, British, etc.)
- [ ] Test how kfa captures accent differences

### 7.3 Accent Demonstrations
- [ ] Same kfa text with different accent synthesis
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison interface
- [ ] Examples: `funetik` (Montana) vs `fuOnetik` (British)
- [ ] Showcase how kfa reveals pronunciation patterns

### 7.4 Accent Documentation
- [ ] Document accent-specific kfa variations
- [ ] Create accent comparison examples
- [ ] Show how kfa can capture regional differences
- [ ] Demonstrate practical applications for accent training

---

## Success Metrics üéØ

- [ ] All 44 English phonemes correctly synthesized in Montana English
- [ ] Gettysburg Address example speaks clearly and naturally
- [ ] Homophones sound identical (wic, TeE, yOr, hOz)
- [ ] Users can easily input and test kfa text
- [ ] App works on mobile and desktop browsers
- [ ] Multiple accent demonstrations working
- [ ] Clear accent variation documentation

- Community-contributed pronunciation corrections
- International English variant support (Australian, Indian, etc.)
- Accent training tools for language learners
- API for other developers to integrate kfa TTS
